%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The presentation preamble shares a lot of content with the regular thesis
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% preamble. However, joining both and creating a 'shared preamble' was found
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% to be pretty error-prone.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Using overlapping but distinct preamble files allows for two stand-alone
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% documents.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Thoughts on fonts:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% metropolis theme has issues with math font (https://github.com/matze/mtheme/issues/263)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The current default/best solution is to use Computer Modern; doesn't look good
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Solution: use high-quality math font. Available as FiraMath, which is in beta.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% It works rather well, but has bugs (e.g. with \dot not centered hor., subscripts too low)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Alternative: use packages of matching non-Fira fonts for math (https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/403734/120853)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 1. 'arevmath' looks too bold. Setting the text-fonts bolder seems unacceptable, they look very nice in the original metropolis theme and should remain unchanged
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 2. 'eulervm' is also bugged with \dot (https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/50273/120853)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 3. newtxsf seems okay for now (https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/422415/fira-sans-math-companion#comment1056174_422415)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Author of newtxsf package recommends it to go along with FiraSans, see their doc.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Uncomment this block for unicode-math font specs.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Currently not used because of beta-status of Fira Math.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% We don't set a roman/main font because that should never be used in presentations.
%\usefonttheme{professionalfonts}% Prevent Beamer from overriding if high-quality fonts are used
%\usepackage{unicode-math}% Requires Unicode font input
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Be specific with font specifications so that it's clear what happens.
