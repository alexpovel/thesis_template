	title = {Modellbildung von Abgasturboladern mit variabler Turbinengeometrie an schnellaufenden Dieselmotoren},
	abstract = {In den vergangenen Jahren stiegen f¨ur die Fahrzeugindustrie die Anforderungen bez¨uglich der
Abgasemissionen kontinuierlich an. Auch in Zukunft werden die Grenzwerte f¨ur Schadstoffe und
damit der anzustrebende Flottenverbrauch weiter gesenkt werden. Deshalb muß die Industrie alle
M¨oglichkeiten aussch¨opfen, die dazu beitragen, die Abgasbestimmungen auch in den n¨achsten
Jahren zu erf¨ullen. Konstruktive Maßnahmen im Bereich des Motors und Ansaugtraktes, der Einspritzanlagen
und der Aufladetechnik gehen einher mit der Entwicklung leistungsf¨ahiger Motorsteuerger
¨ate und der darin integrierten Regelungen, Steuerungen und Diagnosefunktionen. Nicht
zuletzt werden inzwischen auch Konzepte zur Abgasnachbehandlung und -filterung an Dieselmotoren
im Serieneinsatz erprobt. Fahrzeuge mit einem Durchschnittsverbrauch von weniger als
3 l
100km f¨ur Kleinwagen erobern derzeit den Markt. Doch auch in der Oberklasse sind heute verbrauchsg
¨unstige Dieselmotoren verf¨ugbar, die trotz großem Hubraum (2.4 l), einem ausgepr¨agtem
Drehmoment (340Nm) in unteren Drehzahlbereichen und hoher Gesamtleistung einen Durchschnittsverbrauch
von 6.5 l
100km erreichen [1]. Durch den steigenden Anteil der Elektronik in
Form von Mikrorechnern im Fahrzeug ist heute das Potential vorhanden, Funktionen mit komplexen
Reglern und adaptiven Algorithmen zu realisieren. Dennoch sind der Entwicklung und
Applikation neuer Verfahren Grenzen haupts¨achlich durch eingeschr¨ankte Budgets und kurze Entwicklungszeitr
¨aume gesetzt. Neue Sensoren sollen gleichzeitig Informationen ¨uber verschiedene
Betriebszust¨ande liefern, sodaß das Sensorsignal mehrfach genutzt werden kann. Die einzelnen
Komponenten eines vollst¨andigen Motors mit Steuerger¨at sollten schon in einem fr¨uhen Stadium
erprobt werden, m¨oglichst ohne zeitaufwendige, teure Messungen an Pr¨ufst¨anden durchzuf¨uhren.
Die Forderungen nach komplexen, optimierten Komponenten einerseits und niedrigen Entwicklungs-
und St¨uckkosten andererseits lassen sich durch den Einsatz rechnergest¨utzter Werkzeuge
vereinbaren. In den letzten Jahren haben Simulationswerkzeuge, wie z.B. Matlab/Simulink
oder Matrix-X, und Rapid Prototyping Systeme, z.B. {dSpace} oder Ascet, eine große Verbreitung
in verschiedenen Entwicklungszentren erlangt [2]. Bereits erstellte Hardwarekomponenten, z.B.
Motor- oder Getriebesteuerger¨ate, k¨onnen in einer simulierten Umgebung getestet werden (Hardware
in the loop, {HIL}). Neue Steuerger¨atefunktionen k¨onnen unmittelbar in einem Bypass-Betrieb
im Fahrzeug entwickelt, erprobt und optimiert werden, ohne daß bei jedem {IterationsschrittWartezeiten}
auf das jeweils umprogrammierte Steuerger¨at entstehen. Derzeit werden an einigen For12
1 {EINLEITUNG}
schungseinrichtungen objektorientierte Modellbildungs- und Simulationswerkzeuge entwickelt.
Mit diesen Werkzeugen soll Entwicklern erm¨oglicht werden, die ben¨otigten Modelle aus Bauteilbibliotheken
zusammenzustellen. Nach der Parametrierung der Bauteile bzw. Objekte erstellt
der Rechner die zur Simulation notwendigen Gleichungssysteme selbst. Ziel ist, daß der Anwender
dieser Werkzeuge nur noch wenig Detailwissen ¨uber den zu modellierenden Prozeß besitzen muß.
Ein weiterer Trend zeichnet sich durch den vermehrten Einsatz von K¨unstlichen Neuronalen
Netzen ({KNN}) zur Wissensrepr¨asentation ab. Sie werden dabei als eine m¨ogliche Darstellungsform
von Kennfeldern und nichtlinearen Eigenschaften verwendet. Die entstehenden
”
Black-
Box“-Modelle, deren innere, rein datenbasierte Struktur kaum physikalisch interpretierbar ist, werden
z.B. in Simulationen ({HIL}, Rapid Prototyping) eingesetzt. Insbesondere f¨ur nichtlineare oder
schwer zu modellierende Prozesse mit mehreren Ein- und Ausg¨angen, z.B. Abgasturbolader, erscheinen
{KNN} sinnvoll. Der wesentliche Vorteil besteht bei der Anwendung in Steuerger¨aten darin,
daß schnelle Algorithmen zur Berechnung verf¨ugbar sind und {KNN} an zeitvariantes Prozeßverhalten
adaptierbar sind. Ein potentieller Nachteil, der h¨aufig ¨ubersehen wird, ist die Frage, eine
repr¨asentative Auswahl an Trainingsdaten und -signalen f¨ur das Netz festzulegen und damit Systemantworten
zu generieren. Diese werden ben¨otigt, um dem Netz das gew¨unschte statische und
dynamische Verhalten einzupr¨agen, also die Parameter der einzelnen Neuronen und Verbindungen
einzustellen. In der Regel werden daf¨ur Meßdaten verwendet, die aus Pr¨ufstandsversuchen
stammen. Wird eine Komponente, die von dem Netz in einem Regelalgorithmus modelliert wird,
am Motor gegen einen Typ mit anderen Parametern ausgetauscht, muß der Trainingsvorgang mit
neuen Meßdaten wiederholt werden. Das Netz wird an die neue Komponente adaptiert.
Soll bereits bei Simulationen in der Vorentwicklung f¨ur verschiedene Typen einer Komponente
das Verhalten im Gesamtprozeß untersucht werden, k¨onnen in der Regel noch keine Meßdaten f¨ur
das Training von {KNN} generiert werden. Durch die Simulationen will man ja gerade Pr¨ufstandszeiten,
Probeaufbauten und damit verbundene Kosten einsparen.
Durch den Einsatz einfacher Modelle, die auf physikalischen Gesetzen basieren und durch wenige
Parameter eingestellt werden k¨onnen, kann die Simulation jedoch schon ohne Messungen
brauchbare Ergebnisse liefern. Diese Ergebnisse k¨onnen auf jeden Fall auch genutzt werden, um
die innere Struktur von {KNN} festzulegen und ein Basistraining durchzuf¨uhren. Außerdem erlaubt

In this paper, a review and analysis of the major loss mechanisms and loss models, used to determine the efﬁciency of a single stage centrifugal compressor, and a subsequent examination to determine an appropriate loss correlation set for estimating the isentropic efﬁciency in preliminary design stages of centrifugal compressors, were developed. Several semi-empirical correlations, commonly used to predict the efﬁciency of centrifugal compressors, were implemented in {FORTRAN} code and then were compared with experimental results in order to establish a loss correlation set to determine, with good approximation, the isentropic efﬁciency of single stage compressor. The aim of this study is to provide a suitable loss correlation set for determining the isentropic efﬁciency of a single stage centrifugal compressor, because, with a large amount of loss mechanisms and correlations available in the literature, it is difﬁcult to ascertain how many and which correlations to employ for the correct prediction of the efﬁciency in the preliminary stage design of a centrifugal compressor. As a result of this study, a set of correlations composed by nine loss mechanisms for single stage centrifugal compressors, conformed by a rotor and a diffuser, are speciﬁed.},

The compressor is described following an enhanced map-based approach, where proper "virtual pipes" are placed upstream and downstream the compressor to deal with the mass and energy storage and wave propagation effects. The proposed methodology, which takes into account main ﬂow and thermal loss mechanisms, is based on the employment of "extended" compressor maps obtained through a steady version of the 1DCM. The tuning and validation of the 1DCM have been carried out comparing its results with the experimental data. Preliminarily, the steady version of the 1DCM is tuned against to the measured map for various rotational speeds. Subsequently, it is used to derive the extended map, including both direct and reverse ﬂow branches. Finally, the unsteady version of the 1DCM is validated against experimental data denoting a satisfactory agreement, especially in terms of pulse frequency, amplitude and global shape. Summarizing, the proposed model, combining the reduced computational effort typical of 1D simulation with the adoption of advanced features such as "virtual pipe" and extended compressor map, shows the capability to capture the phenomenology of the compressor surging.},

	abstract = {The paper deals with the simulation of a multi-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine for automotive applications, employing a one-dimensional approach with the aim of refining the turbocharger modelling during transient manoeuvres. The proposed methodology is able to handle stable compressor behaviour and also compressor surge. In addition, a wastegate model is introduced to account for the instantaneous variation in the valve section as a result of the control signal, which is provided by the engine control unit, and the engine state. Preliminarily, the engine model is tuned against experimental data in terms of both the global performance parameters and the in-cylinder pressure cycles. The compressor performance is described through an ‘extended’ map obtained using a one-dimensional turbocharger model; in this way, a refined surge analysis can be performed, accounting for both direct flow compressor operations and reverse flow compressor operations. The one-dimensional model is applied to analyse different transient manoeuvres. First, the vehicle’s maximum speed is predicted and compared with the manufacturer’s data, during an acceleration manoeuvre. Then, a sudden part-to-full-load step is described with the aim of analysing in detail the turbo-lag. Finally, a full-to-part-transient manoeuvre is also analysed to verify the capability of the model to represent the compressor surge phenomenon. The numerical results provided in this work qualitatively reproduce the experimental observations available in the literature for transient operation of engines. Thus, the developed computational tool can be successfully used to support the design process and the transient analysis of turbocharged internal-combustion engines.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a novel method of designing the {HP} compressor of a two-stage turbocharger using a 1-D code coupled with an optimisation algorithm. The 1-D code solves relevant thermodynamic and fluid dynamics equations given geometric variables, the target pressure ratio and the operating speed as inputs. A multiobjective optimiser is used to return potential designs that will maximise compressor efficiency and minimise deviation from the target mass flow. These designs are then taken forward for detailed 3D-{CFD} analysis. An example based on a {HP} compressor impeller and vaneless diffuser is presented to demonstrate the potential of this 1-D methodology.},

A transient model of the high pressure system of an {IAE} V2500 is therefore developed. It consists of the high pressure compressor, combustion chamber and high pressure turbine. In this simulation setup, each component is modelled by its respective component map. To achieve the most accurate read-out of the component maps, different approaches for their implementation into the simulation have been examined. To further increase the models accuracy, the gas properties dependency on temperature and chemical composition of the fluid is taken into account. The properties of the gas are calculated for each station along the gas path. Downstream of the combustion chamber, the composition of the fluid varies dependent on the fuel to air ratio. Due to the fact, the chemical reaction in the combustion chamber is included in the simulation setup. The combination of advanced map read-out methods and variable gas properties leads to a model in Simulink which shows the transient behaviour of the high pressure system and converges to a reliable steady state.},

	abstract = {An anal ysis method and a design method are developed for onedimensional,
compressible flow with friction, heat transfer, and area
change in vaneless diffusers with arbitrary profiles in the axial-radial
plane . The effects of mixing l osses due to nonuniform flow conditions
at the i mpeller discharge are not considered. In the analysis method
the variations in fluid propert i es, including the vel ocity and flow
direction, are determined as a function of radius for a prescribed variation
in diffuser wall spacing with radius. In the design method the
variations in effective diffuser wal l spacing and in the fluid properties
are determined as a function of r adius for an arbitrary prescribed
variation in one f l uid property. For efficient diffuser designs the
fluid property selected and the manner in which its variation is prescribed
will depend on viscous flow effects that are considered in
boundary-layer studies but are not investigated in this report.
As a resul t of numerical examples it is concluded that: (1) Even
with relatively low friction coefficients and neglecting mixing losses
near the impeller t i p , the fr i ction losses in most vaneless diffuser
designs are considerable, as indicated by computed diffuser efficiencies
in the l ow 80 l s, and these losses result from the usually large ratios
of wetted surface to flow area in vaneless diffusers. (2) Vaneless
diffuser efficiencies can be improved by increased compressor flow rates
for a given impeller tip radius so that the diffuser walls can be spaced
farther apart (thus, reducing the r atio of wetted surface to flow area)
without i ncreasing the length of the flow path in the diffuser.},

	abstract = {Global warming is a climate phenomenon with world-wide ecological, economic and social impact which calls for strong measures in reducing automotive fuel consump-tion and thus {CO}2 emissions. In this regard, turbocharging and the associated de-signing of the air path of the engine are key technologies in elaborating more efficient and downsized engines. The development, parameterization and testing of model-based air path control strategies require adequate performance maps characterizing the working behavior of turbochargers. The working behavior is typically identified on test rig which is expensive in terms of costs and time required. Hence, the objective of the research project "virtual Exhaust Gas Turbocharger" ({vEGTC}) is an alternative approach which considers a physical modeled {vEGTC} to allow a founded prediction of efficiency, pressure rise as well as pressure losses of an arbitrary turbocharger with known geometry. The model is conceived to use smallest possible number of geometry as well as material parameters. Thus, conventional expensive and time-consuming application processes can be countered and test rig as well as in vehicle measurements can be reduced. Furthermore, the {vEGTC} model enables the predic-tion of different turbocharger behavior caused by geometry variations. Within this paper it is shown in which way the radial compressor as a representative modeling component can be described by zero-dimensional equations: in order to simulate the working behavior of the compressor the geometry, the thermodynamic state of the inlet-air and the turbocharger speed are assumed to be known. The loss mechanisms are devised using analytical and semi-empirical loss correlations. In or-der to determine the compressor efficiency the heat transfer from the turbine to the compressor is considered. Finally, the simulation output is compared to the experi-mentally generated maps of three different turbochargers pointing out the reliability of the model. Thus, a comprehensive validation of the {vEGTC} model is yielded. The object-oriented language Modelica is used for modeling and the simulations are pro-vided by the Dymola solver.},

In the new method the performance of the whole map is also based on these four parameters through physically based algebraic equations which require little prior knowledge of the detailed geometry. The variable empirical coefficients in the parameterized equations can be calibrated to match the performance maps of a wide range of stage types, including turbocharger and process compressor impellers with vaned and vaneless diffusers. The examples provided show that the efficiency and the pressure ratio performance maps of turbochargers with vaneless diffusers can be predicted to within ±2\% in this way. More uncertainty is present in the prediction of the surge line, as this is very variable from stage to stage. During the preliminary design the method provides a useful reference performance map based on earlier experience for comparison with objectives at different speeds and flows.},

	abstract = {This thesis outlines the development of a centrifugal compressor model for the Turbocharger Component Matching System ({TuCMS}) software package that can be used to inexpensively analyze turbocharger performance. The {TuCMS} can also be used to match turbocharger components to integrate and optimize turbocharger-engine performance. The software system is being developed with the intent to reduce the time taken to experimentally match a turbocharger with an engine, a task that is key to engine emission reductions. The {TuCMS} uses one-dimensional thermo-fluid equations to analyze the compressor side of a turbocharger. For each compressor component, the program calculates the velocities, pressures, temperatures, pressure losses, work consumption, and efficiencies for a specified set of turbocharger geometry, atmospheric conditions, rotational speed, and fluid mass flow rate. The compressor includes established loss models found in the open literature. The {TuCMS} utilizes a component-based architecture to simplify model enhancements. The {TuCMS} can be used as a cost effective engineering tool for preliminary turbocharger testing during engine upgrades and modifications. In this thesis, the {TuCMS} compressor model was used as an analysis tool to further understand the Variable Geometry Turbocharger ({VGT}) experimental results. The {VGT} is a unique turbocharger that can change the diffuser vane angle over a wide range of positions. The change in diffuser vane angle results in optimal turbocharger performance at various operating conditions, and potentially increases the operating range. The purpose for the use of the {TuCMS} compressor model analysis is to identify the change in performance as the diffuser vane angles are adjusted. The {TuCMS} can ideally be used as a control program for the {VGT} to adjust the diffuser vane angles as the compressor load changes and insure the compressor is operating at the highest efficiency.},

	abstract = {The Two-Element In Series ({TEIS}) and Two-Zone models have been used
successfully for over twenty years to model test data for radial flow compressors and
pumps. The models can also be used to predict the performance of new machines
provided that the model inputs can be accurately specified. Unfortunately, use of the
{TEIS} and Two-Zone models as a predictive tool has been limited because an accurate and
broadly applicable method of predicting the modeling parameters, η
a, η
b, χ and δ2p does
not exist.
Empirical models have been developed to predict the {TEIS} and Two-Zone
modeling parameters based on a large database of centrifugal pump and compressor test
results. These test data were provided by {ConceptsNREC} and have been collected over
the past 40 years. The database consists of a wide range of machines including some that
were designed and tested by {ConceptsNREC} and others from the open literature.
Only cases with a vaneless diffuser or volute have been included in the analysis to avoid
any possible impeller-diffuser interactions.
From the database, models for all of the {TEIS} and Two-Zone parameters have
been derived using basic regression techniques. Three different models are proposed for
each of the two {TEIS} modeling parameters, η
a and η
b. One model for pumps, another for
compressors, and a combined model applicable for all machines is given. For the Twozone
parameters, χ and δ2p, a single set of models was developed to represent the design
point performance and another showing how χ and δ2p vary off-design.
The combined models for η
a and ηb are 30\% and 70\% more accurate than the
current state-of-the-art models, respectively. The new models account for the variance in
χ and δ2p at off-design flow conditions and further refine the accuracy of the overall
prediction by correctly modeling the loss mechanisms in the impeller passage.
Validation work has shown that the set of models that predict η
a, η
b, χ and δ2p can be
solved to consistently produce sensible results and yield a reasonable “blind” prediction
of the performance of a wide range of radial compressors and pumps. These models
constitute the first broadly applicable method for predicting the required {TEIS} and Two-
Zone variables and are sufficiently accurate to provide initial performance estimates of
new impeller designs.},

	abstract = {An moderne Flugtriebwerke werden hohe Anforderungen in Bezug auf Wirtschaftlichkeit und Umweltverträglichkeit gestellt. Dies gilt folglich auch für die einzelnen Komponenten wie beispielsweise den Verdichter. Die Strömung durch diesen ist komplex und kann durch eine Vielzahl von Parametern verändert werden. Zu Beginn der Auslegungsphase eines Verdichters werden daher mit Hilfe von Vorauslegeprogrammen die Basisparameter festgelegt, wie beispielsweise die Stufenanzahl. Zu diesem Zweck wird die Strömung durch den Verdichter zunächst eindimensional auf dem Mittenschnitt für eine repräsentative Geometrie berechnet. Dabei werden Strömungsphänomene modellhaft durch Korrelationen angenähert. Es ist daher für den gesamten Auslegungsprozess essentiell, dass diese über eine hohe Vorhersagegenauigkeit verfügen. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es, letztere zu erhöhen.
Aus diesem Grund werden existierende Korrelationen der 2D-Profilumströmung (Diffusionszahl, minimaler Profilverlust und Deviation) überarbeitet und auf Parameter aktueller Verdichter angepasst. Für weitere Untersuchungen stehen eine umfangreiche experimentelle Datenbasis sowie Ergebnisse der Numerik und die eines eigenen analytischen Verdichtermodells zur Auswertung zur Verfügung. Aus diesen werden neue Erkenntnisse und Modelle für Strömungsphänomene im Schaufelspitzenbereich tip-kritischer Verdichter abgeleitet. Im Fokus steht dabei vor allem die Auswirkung von Blockage in Bezug auf den Leistungseintrag und den Arbeitsbereich. Zunächst wird detailliert auf die Verminderung der Leistung durch die Spaltströmung eingegangen, die sich mit Hilfe einer neuen Stufenkenngröße quantifizieren lässt. Daraus leitet sich ein neues Verfahren zur Berechnung von Blockage ab. Im Anschluss ist das Überrollen von Verdichtercharakteristiken Gegenstand der Untersuchung. Abschließend werden die erzielten Ergebnisse und neuen Methoden zur Modellierung von Gehäusestrukturierungen verwendet. Aus diesem einfachen Modell lässt sich die Arbeitsbereicherweiterung abschätzen, die durch den Einsatz von Gehäusestrukturierungen möglich sind.},

	abstract = {Turbo charging is a way for car manufacturers to meet the major challenge of fuel economyand reduction of the {CO}2 emissions. The aim is to replace current engines with a downsized engine in order to improve its fuel consumption. This requires higher specific power and torque especially at very low engine speed. The wide functioning area required for this technique leads to an operation of compressors at low air flow rate and high compression ratio characterised by the occurrence of surge phenomenon. On the engine, it can be intensified by the fuel flow rate pulses consecutive to air flow rate pulses leading to torque oscillations. In fact, surge is an aerodynamic instability that affects both the compressor and its associated network which results in strong pressure and mass flow rate oscillations describing a surge cycle in the compressor map. The surge limit of a centrifugal compressor and its frequency are highly dependant on the geometrical configuration of its associated network. In this paper, the experimental work was focused on the study of the surge behaviour of a centrifugal compressor by means of a turbocharger test bench and the influence of the upstream and downstream circuit (volumes sizes and pipes lengths) and their interaction at the surge limit, the frequency and the unsteady fluctuations amplitude of this phenomenon. A comparative study of our experimental results with the Greitzer model was also done in terms of surge frequency and intensity prediction.},

The simulation method was validated against turbocharger test data. Results show that the methods can predict the turbocharger performance with a good accuracy, less than 5 per cent error in general for both the compressor and the turbine. In comparison with the map-based extrapolation methods commonly used in engine cycle simulation tools such as {GT}-{POWER}®, the turbocharger simulation method showed significant improvement in predictive accuracy to simulate the turbocharger performance, especially in low-flow and low-operating-speed conditions.},

The code is based on analytical models from literature and includes vaneless compressor inlet, impeller, vaneless diffuser and a volute. The impeller exit flow is modelled using a modified two-zone approach which accounts for the interaction of aerodynamic blockage and diffusion. Thermal and pressure losses inside the impeller are computed using different collections of loss models from open literature. The data are used to evaluate the percentage of individual loss mechanisms on the overall losses. The predicted performance is compared with highly resolved numerical simulations and experiments. A correlation for the minimal boundary of the aerodynamic blockage coefficient at different operating points is derived from the numerical results which serves as input to the analytical model.},

	abstract = {Engine simulation programs presently include the simulation of the engine together with
its manifolds and the turbocharger. Most of the existing engine simulation models are
based on measured turbocharger performance maps. Usually, these maps cover only a
limited operating range. Therefore, they cannot be used to simulate the turbocharger
performance at every engine rotational speed and are unable to adequately model partload
performance which in passenger cars prevails throughout most of engine operating
life.
The present paper aims at providing a physically meaningful method of
turbocharger performance prediction. This method takes into account the heat flow in
turbochargers as well as the aerodynamic performance of the compressor and the
turbine, respectively. It uses the measured performance maps as a basis for the
turbocharger performance simulation, extending the compressor performance prediction
down to zero rotational speed.
Engine operating points are simulated using the method proposed above at low
turbocharger rotational speeds to investigate the effect of heat transfer from the turbine
to the compressor on the engine simulation in this operating range. The computational
results of both, zero-dimensional and one-dimensional engine process models, show a
better match with experimental data than previous engine calculations with nonphysically
based turbocharger models},

Unfortunately, such maps that described by experimental results do not cover each condition. This is due to expenses as well as the uncovering operational zones. Therefore, map prediction is important, however, it is very complex because of its nonlinearity as well as unstable region that are not easily to be assigned practically. Consequently, the present work introduced a methodology that predicts the centrifugal compressors performance maps specified at stable and unstable conditions. Enhancement the compressor performance map is performed using the closed coupled valve and variable drive speed where the later method was more preferable based on shifting of the compressor map towards lower flow rate with less pressure drop.},

@thesis{tacconi_investigation_2018,
	location = {Delft},
	title = {Investigation of a semi-closed cycle small gas turbine for high altitude {UAV} propulsion},
	abstract = {Semi-closed cycles have been successfully employed in di erent engineering areas, such as in marine
and power generation. The primary characteristic of a semi-closed cycle arrangement is that
a considerable portion of the total mass 
ow required for a certain power output is recirculated
within the engine itself. As a consequence, the amount of inlet fresh air supplied has only to be
su cient to sustain the combustion process. The resultant gas turbines have shown competitive
performance with a higher level of compactness with respect to conventional aero-derived open
cycle solutions.
In the aerospace world, many authors have discussed the advantages of using heat exchangers
to considerably improve the thermal e ciency of turboshaft and turboprop engines. In particular,
for applications where the turbomachinery e ciency is dramatically limited by size and
Reynolds e ects. A considerable limitation of this approach is related to the increased engine
weight due to the addition of intercoolers and/or recuperators. Therefore, resultant engines
are always product of compromising solutions between size/weight and thermodynamic performance,
leveling-o  the heat exchangers introduction advantages.
Few publications have pointed out that the employment of semi-closed cycle architectures could
be bene cial for aerospace applications that necessitate their usage for reaching good performance
and contained weights, such as for the unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV}) case. However,
the only detailed semi-closed cycle assessment available in literature goes back to the 1995 under
the {NASA} {ERAST} (Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology) program. The
{NASA} study, focused on the technological development of high altitude long endurance {UAVs} for
scienti c purposes, showed the advantages introduced by a particular intercooled-recuperated
semi-closed cycle arrangement, named Coleman engine, with respect to other conventional solutions,
such as: spark ignition, diesel, rotary, fuel cells and shaft engines.
This Master thesis revisits the design case and some of the observations introduced within
the {ERAST} program and presents a detailed performance comparison focused on gas turbine
engines for high altitude {UAV} applications. In particular, the performance of two di erent semiclosed
cycle con gurations have been compared with the state-of-the-art open cycle equivalent,
represented by the simple recuperated and the intercooled-recuperated engines, for di erent
technological levels. The  rst semi-closed cycle arrangement has been taken from the {NASA}
{ERAST} program, while, the second has been derived from further research studies conducted
by the University of Florida for marine applications, which have also brought to the realization
of a preliminary engine prototype in the early 2000s, under the so called {HPRTE} (High Pressure
Regenerative Turbine Engine) program.
The thermodynamic cycle model of the four engines considered has been created with the support
of the program {NPSS} (Numerical Propulsion System Simulation), an object oriented environment
built in C++language, suitable for the cycle design and o -design steady state analysis of
conventional and unconventional gas turbine con gurations. This program has been coupled
{IV}
with a detailed component performance and weight model, with the objective of assessing feasibility,
design/o -design performance behavior and size/weight characteristics of primary engine
components (compressors, turbines, combustor, heat exchangers, etc.) as function of given thermodynamic
cycle parameters. Moreover, the developed tool has been coupled with an optimizer,
which has direct control of the engine thermodynamics.
For each engine model, a multi-objective optimization has been carried out with minimum speci
 c fuel consumption ({SFC}) and weight as target. The  rst objective has been de ned from
the evaluation of the engine design and part-power performance, while the second, as the sum
of the individual component weights, estimated by means of the developed weight model. The
Matlab evolutionary algorithm, called gamultiobj, has been employed for the optimization. Furthermore,
the {ERAST} case study has been taken as reference to de ne the 
ight conditions and
to set the engine design and o -design power output requirements for the analysis. In addition,
the optimization has been performed assuming a single shaft architecture and equivalent turbomachinery
features for all the engine models.
The  nal optimized Pareto solutions have been used to compare attainable performance and
weights of the semi-closed cycle and the open cycle arrangements. Results have proven that a
signi cant degree of compactness can be achieved by means of the semi-closed cycle con gurations,
leading to an overall engine weight more than two times lower than for a conventional
intercooled-recuperated gas turbine. Further bene ts have been observed in terms of design and
part-power performance, where, for the same engine power output demand, semi-closed cycles
have shown a slight reduction in {SFC} with respect to the equivalent open cycles analyzed.},

@thesis{schiff_preliminary_2013,
	location = {Lund, Sweden},
	title = {A Preliminary Design Tool for Radial Compressors},
	abstract = {The aim of this thesis has been to implement a computer program capable of modelling
radial compressors. The work was conducted at the Division of Thermal Power Engineering,
Department of Energy Sciences at the Faculty of Engineering, Lund University.
With such a large field as radial compressors, some decomposition of the subject was
necessary. This thesis focuses on modelling the impeller and diffuser of the compressor, where
the components are individually studied. By doing this division between different parts of the
compressor, the individual components can be designed in isolation. If, for instance, only a
vaned diffuser is to be designed, no impeller design must first be found.
The resulting computer program called {LURC} (Lund University Radial Compressor) have
two different design tools for the impeller, one in-depth impeller flow analysis, one vaneless
diffuser design tool and one vaned diffuser design tool. The compressor designer can easily
perform different analyses with {LURC}, all design tools being easily accessible at all times. Also,
several of the different analysis tools are interconnected, allowing easy data exchange.
The so-called preliminary impeller design tool requires minimum input data from the
user, quickly yielding a promising impeller design. It is a one-dimensional analysis method,
where most parameters are specified on the mean streamline. The complete impeller geometry
is directly generated, making it a perfect tool for the non-experienced compressor designer.
Further, the result can be used as input data in any of the two diffuser analyses.
In the detailed impeller design tool more input data must be specified. Also, the geometry
and blade shapes are under full control of the designer. This analysis is also one-dimensional
but has the capability of creating three-dimensional impeller geometries. Such a tool is well
suited to the more experienced designer, knowing what he or she want to achieve. The result
can be used in both diffuser analyses, but also in the in-depth impeller flow analysis.
The in-depth impeller flow analysis is based on a quasi three-dimensional calculation
method. In this case a streamline curvature method is coupled with a stream function flow
analysis, allowing the three-dimensional problem to be composed of two two-dimensional ones.
From this analysis tool the velocity distributions along the blades may be found, giving the
experienced designer a vital piece of information.
Vaneless diffusers are very common in radial compressors, making it important to incorporate
these in {LURC}. Input data may be entered manually or imported from a previous impeller
analysis. The analysis is based on one-dimensional theory, including effects of wall friction. The
complete geometry is generated and the key results, such as discharge pressure and velocity,
are calculated.
The vaned diffuser design tool are focused on channel diffusers of the wedge type. Also
included in the analysis are the vaneless space right after the impeller discharge. As was the
case for the vaneless diffuser design tool, inlet data can be entered either manually or fetched
from an impeller analysis conducted earlier. The whole diffuser geometry is generated, that is,
both the vaneless space and the channel diffuser part. One-dimensional compressible channel
flow is the basis for this analysis.
{LURC} fulfils its main objective; being a fast design tool for establishing promising compressor
stage designs. Although mainly based on one-dimensional analyses, it is a very efficient and
powerful tool for determining important design parameters in a timely fashion},

and control applications is an established practice that relies on the steady-state maps provided
by manufacturer suppliers. However, as often occurs in practice, only a limited fraction
of data is available in the compressor and turbine operating domain. For this reason,
several modelling techniques have been proposed to interpolate and extrapolate flow and
efficiency data. Most of the modelling approaches, based on black- or grey-box approaches,
have limited predictive ability and typically low accuracy in off-design conditions, such as at
engine idle or low engine speed. The current paper presents a novel model-based approach
for overcoming the sparse nature of the available compressor maps, characterizing the flow
and efficiency outputs of automotive centrifugal compressors by using extrapolation methods
that are physically consistent with the conservation principles and actual behaviour of
the system. The approach relies on a predictive model based on the thermodynamic analysis
of a centrifugal compressor stage. The model builds upon the mass, energy, and entropy balance
equations for compressible fluids. Specific sub-models are then introduced to account
for the effects of slip phenomena, incidence losses, friction, and heat transfer losses, leading
to high fidelity and predictive ability in off-design conditions. A detailed analysis of the
model calibration and validation process is presented, utilizing data from two different
automotive compressors. Finally, the procedure described is applied to characterize the
compressor performance in engine system simulation, in comparison with a conventional
(data-driven) model.},

	abstract = {Diesel engines are gaining in popularity, penetrating even
the luxury and sports vehicle segments that have traditionally
been strongly favored gasoline engines as the performance and
refinement of diesel engines have improved significantly in
recent years. The introduction of sophisticated technologies
such as common rail injection ({CRI}), advanced boosting
systems such as variable geometry and multi-stage
turbocharging, and exhaust gas after-treatment systems have
renewed the interest in Diesel engines.
Among the technical advancements of diesel engines, the
multi-stage turbocharging is the key to achieve such high
power density that is suitable for the luxury and sports vehicle
applications. Single-stage turbocharging is limited to roughly
2.5 bar of boost pressure. In order to raise the boost pressure up
to levels of 4 bar or so, another turbocharger must be connected
in series further multiplying the pressure ratio. The dual-stage
turbocharging, however, adds system complexity, and the
matching of two turbochargers becomes very costly if it is to be
done experimentally.
This study presents a simulation-based methodology for
dual-stage turbocharger matching through an iterative
procedure predicting optimal configurations of compressors
and turbines. A physics-based zero-dimensional Diesel engine
system simulation with a dual-stage turbocharger is
implemented in {SIMULINK} environment, allowing easy
evaluation of different configurations and subsequent analysis
of engine system performance. The simulation program is
augmented with a turbocharger matching program and a
turbomachinery scaling routine.
The configurations considered in the study include a dualstage
turbocharging system with a bypass valve added to the
high pressure turbine, and a system with a wastegate valve
added to a low-pressure turbine. The systematic simulation
study allows detailed analysis of the impact of each of the
configurations on matching, boost characteristics and transient
response. The configuration with the bypass valve across high
pressure turbine showed better results in terms of both steady
state engine torque and transient behavior.},

@thesis{mohtar_increasing_2010,
	location = {Nantes, France},
	title = {Increasing surge margin of turbocharger centrifugal compressor automotive application},
	abstract = {The ever increasingly stringent exhaust emissions legislation and fuel prices are forcing the
automotive engine designers to demand increased pressure ratio from the turbocharger
compressor, this to ensure complete combustion of the fuel, thereby reducing engine
displacement while maintaining or even increasing output power, the so called downsizing.
Downsizing has experienced a notable increasing trend in the recent years. For this type of
application it is essential to maintain the stable operating range of the compressor as
increased pressure is demanded, otherwise inadequate charge air supply will lead to poor
combustion, poor specific fuel consumption, reduced power and increased pollutants.
Due to their high efficiencies and high pressure ratio they produce compared to positive
displacement compressors, radial centrifugal compressors are commonly used in
turbochargers. The turbocharger compressor, in turn, is required to give a broad operating
range between surge and choke, and at the same time match the engine speed range, which
is very low compared to compressor speed. It is the inherent mismatch of high speed
turbochargers to a low speed reciprocating internal combustion engine which provides
difficulties for engine designers to produce an optimized combination [Abdullah, 1996].
As it can be shown in Figure I. The compressor map becomes narrower as the compressor
pressure ratio increases, i.e. the stable operating range, between surge at low flow rates and
choke at high flow rates, decreases. Operation in the unstable condition [surge zone] is
undesirable due to the violent pressure pulsations, shaft/bearing noise and vibration which
accompany it. Prolonged operation under such severe condition may lead to mechanical
failure. On the other hand, choke is related to the occurrence of a sonic condition at a throat
section of the compressor stage [throat of the impeller eye [inducer] or at the entry of the
vaneless diffuser or at the throat of a vaned diffuser [case of vaned diffuser]], and leads to a
rapid reduction in efficiency with only a small increase in mass flow.
For turbocharger compressors, a broad operating range between surge and choke is of such
importance that efficiency levels are often sacrificed for flow range.
Although centrifugal compressor instabilities has been widely investigated in the literature,
most studies were focused on radial compressors for industrial or aeronautical applications,
whose operating condition differs of those of engine applications. Rare investigations have
been done to study instabilities in turbocharger centrifugal compressors except in some
particular conditions [Chesse et al., 2000 for marine application, and Galindo et al, 2006 for
automotive application].
Instabilities in a centrifugal compressor are stall and surge, where centrifugal compressor
surge is provoked by a stage stall, which in turn is a collective stall of different compressor
elements or a strong stall in one component.
Different studies have been conducted to suppress surge and to compensate for the stable
range reduction while increasing pressure capabilities, different experimental techniques
including variable geometry techniques, fixed geometry techniques may be considered to be
a promising solution. Potential areas for the application of these techniques are the inlet to
the discharge of the impeller, diffuser and the volute. However, prior to giving rules which are
intended to predict or delay surge in turbocharger compressors, it is necessary to understand
instabilities in all compressor components and trying to suppress these instabilities may be a
way to suppress stage stall.},

I. C. E. analysis, based upon an unsteady
non-dimensional flow-model, whose accuracy level
has been improved by means of experimental
investigations. Experimental activities allowed a
higher prediction level to be reached for both
engine cycles and turbocharger operation.
The results are also compared with those of an
experimental methodology recently proposed by the
authors, based upon one-dimensional unsteady flow
models and fast pressure data acquisition.
The method is mainly utilized, in this paper,
as to compare the effects of two different
turbochargers on engine performance and
turbomachinery operating conditions. The engine
and turbocharger matching is considered under
both steady and transient conditions.},
