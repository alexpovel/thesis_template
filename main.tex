This template emerged from a Master thesis in \textbf{mechanical engineering}.
Keeping that in mind, it is probably still absolutely suitable for countless other disciplines.
Adapt and use this template as you wish; giving credit to the original repository at

would be appreciated, so that interested collaborators can join.
