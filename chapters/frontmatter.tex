\textit{The most commonly used symbols are listed here, alongside their location of first occurrence. Symbols used but not listed here are clarified in their respective contexts.}

\textit{\textbf{Buggy:} You will notice that the majority of symbols do not have info on the location of their first use.
These are all the symbols which first occurred in \textbf{floats}.
The way this document was set up, most symbols are affected.
Referencing floats is a tricky business and is apparently still faulty at the moment.
In an actual document, it is extremely likely you will be introducing symbols in text or math mode, not in floats, negating this issue.}
