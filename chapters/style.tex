\section{Text Features}
Between any section commands (from \verb|\part| down), there always has to be some content.
I would normally not know what to put between \textbf{Text Features} and \textbf{Fonts}, but really putting \textit{anything} I consider necessary.
Anything else looks off.
At least, tell the reader what the following hierarchical level contains for them.

small spaces \ 

Note the usage of --- in the previous sentence.
Use \verb|---| in the source code to have an em-dash---perhaps even without surrounding spaces?
That is probably up to your choice.
What is not, because it is largely agreed on, is to use \verb|--| -- an en-dash -- instead.
It is reserved for number ranges.
Lastly, a single hy-phen is reserved for just that --- hyphenation.

ALWAYS write what you *mean*, not what also gives the correct output
