Mtheme has issues with math font, https://github.com/matze/mtheme/issues/263

**Solution**: use `unicode-math` ourselves. **Problem**: proper fonts, especially for math, required:

Sans from https://github.com/bBoxType/FiraSans in version 4.3

Math from https://github.com/firamath/firamath in version 0.4_beta-3, found at https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/411259/120853

Mono from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono in version 3.2 (?)
